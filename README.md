# CloudUploader to Google Cloud Storage
A bash-based CLI tool that allows you to quickly upload a file to a specified cloud storage solution, providing a simple and seamless upload experience similar to popular storage services.

# To make it work
You can install the Cloud Uploader with git clone.
If you dont have git on you system you can install it with: "sudo apt-get install git" (keep in mind that this only works with Ubuntu and Debian)

For Fedora-based systems, use: sudo dnf install gir
For Arch-based systems, use: sudo pacman -S git

If you already have git you can download the Uploader with: "git clone https://username/repository.git

replace https://username/repository.git with the actual URL of this repository.

This is my very first project.

# Future upgrades
Upload multiple files at once
Add a progress bar
Enable file synchronization --if the file already exists in the cloud I want to have the user overwrite, rename or skip.
Integrate encryption
